            <h2>The Purpose:  </h2>
            <p>Many student athletes find themselves letting their 
                sport take control of their life. Fewer than 2% of NCAA 
                athletes go on to play professionally, which in this case, 
                is understandable for a student to priotize athletics. However,
                the other 98% of the NCAA student athlete population will 
                soon live a life without their sport. Outlet provides a list 
                of resources from the university customized for the user's hobbies
                and interests.</p>
